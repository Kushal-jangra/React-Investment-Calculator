# React-Investment-Calculator
Welcome to my React-Investment-Calculator project! Here, I built a practical investment calculator using modern React concepts and best practices. My goal was to create a user-friendly tool that demonstrates how React can handle dynamic calculations and interactive forms.

React Concepts I Used
Functional Components:
I structured the app using functional components for clean, modular code.

JSX:
The UI is built with JSX, making the layout readable and maintainable.

State Management (useState):
I used React’s useState hook to manage user inputs and calculation results in real time.

Props:
Data flows between components via props, ensuring modularity.

Event Handling:
I implemented robust event handlers to process user input and trigger calculations.

Component Composition:
The application is broken down into reusable, focused components for scalability and clarity.

Features & Highlights
Interactive Form:
Users can input investment details like initial amount, annual contribution, expected return, and duration.

Dynamic Calculations:
The calculator processes inputs instantly and displays results, demonstrating React’s reactivity.

Clear Output Display:
Results are presented in a structured, easy-to-understand format.

Clean Project Structure:
The codebase is organized for readability and future expansion.

This project is a great example of how I apply React fundamentals to solve real-world problems, combining interactive UI with dynamic logic in a maintainable way.
